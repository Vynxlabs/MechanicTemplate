### Component System (Bookshop)

Each component consists of:
- `{name}.bookshop.yml` - Schema with `spec`, `blueprint`, and `_inputs`
- `{name}.eleventy.liquid` - Liquid template
- `{name}.scss` - SASS source file (tailwind is used as the primary CSS framework)

**Component patterns:**
- Components with both content and styles use `tabbed: true` in spec
- Simple components (styles-only or content-only) are flattened
- Sub-components use `{% bookshop_include "renderBlocks" blocks: contentSections %}`

**Page structure (frontmatter):**
```yaml
hero:
  _bookshop_name: generic/hero
  _componentId: <UUID>
content_blocks:
  - _bookshop_name: sections/cards
    _componentId: <UUID>
```

### Key Configuration Files

- `.eleventy.js` - Main Eleventy config with collections, filters, image processing
- `src/_data/site.json` - Site configuration (navigation, contact, analytics)
- `src/_data/theme.yml` - Color groups and design tokens
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration

### Token System

Design tokens are replaced at build time:
- `[[tk.tokenName]]` - Replaced with values from `tokens.yml`
- `[[st.fieldName]]` - Replaced with values from `site.json`

### Image Handling

Use the `{% image %}` shortcode for responsive images:
- Remote URLs are fetched and cached for 365 days
- Local images generate responsive variants (200-1600px widths)
- GIFs are served as-is (not processed)
- LQIP (Low Quality Image Placeholder) for lazy loading

### Collections

Defined in `.eleventy.js`:
- `blog` - All posts in reverse date order
- `pages` - Static pages
- `services` - Service listings
- `happenings` / `upcomingHappenings` / `pastHappenings` - Events
- `listings` - Marketplace listings

### Internationalization (Rosey)

Off by default, behind the `ROSEY_ENABLED` env var. With it unset the build output
is byte-identical to a site without Rosey. Uses **Rosey v2** with the
**CloudCannon Connector v2** (inline translating in the Visual Editor).

All configuration lives in `/rosey.yml`: `default_language` (the language the
site is AUTHORED in) and `languages` (the locales to translate into). Nothing in
this codebase assumes English — a Spanish-first site sets `default_language: es`
and lists `en` under `languages`, and English becomes a translation like any
other. The original is served from `/`, every locale from `/<code>/`.

Adding a locale:

```bash
# 1. add the code to `languages` in rosey.yml, then
npm run rosey:sync   # creates src/rosey/locales/<code>.json + the data_config entry
```

`npm run rosey:sync` is the only thing that edits the generated `data_config`
block in `cloudcannon.config.yml` (between `# rosey:locales:start/end` markers) —
never edit that block by hand. Removing a language archives its locale file to
`src/rosey/locales-disabled/` rather than deleting it, so translations survive.
`npm run test:roseySync` fails if the three ever drift apart.

Pipeline: `npm run eleventy` (tags content) then `npm run rosey`, which runs
`rosey generate` → `rcc write-locales` → `rcc install-client` → `rosey build` →
`rosey check`. Editors translate inline in the Visual Editor via the connector's
locale switcher, or through the CloudCannon **Translations** collection
(`src/rosey/locales/`).

**Every new component that renders text must be tagged.** Use the filters in
`src/filters/rosey-filters.js` — all return `""` when the flag is off, so tagging
never changes default output:

| Filter | Use for | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `roseyTag` | text that is the element's only content | `<h2{{ text \| roseyTag: "heading" }}>{{ text }}</h2>` |
| `roseyWrap` | text sharing an element with sibling markup (icon, control) | `<a>{% icon %}{{ text \| roseyWrap: "label" }}</a>` |
| `roseyMarkdown` | blocks rendered through `markdownify` (gives editors a rich-text input) | `<div{{ text \| roseyMarkdown: "body" }}>{{ text \| markdownify }}</div>` |
| `roseyAttrs` | translatable attributes | `<img alt="{{ alt }}"{{ alt \| roseyAttrs: "alt", "alt" }}>` |
| `roseyNs` | adding a namespace segment | `<section{{ _uuid \| roseyNs }}>` |
| `roseyRoot` | opening a root namespace (also stops upward traversal) | `<footer{{ "common" \| roseyRoot }}>` |
| `roseyStrip` | snippet wrappers: removes every tag from rendered output | `{{ output \| roseyStrip \| strip }}` |

Prefer these filters over an `{% if rosey.enabled %}` block: `{% render %}` gives
partials an isolated scope where `rosey.enabled` is invisible, but filters always
resolve.

**The filters exist twice and must stay identical.** The Visual Editor shows
Bookshop's in-browser re-render, not `dist/`, and the RCC client reads
`data-rosey*` from that live DOM. `src/filters/rosey-filters.js` (Eleventy) and
`_component-library/bookshop/rosey.js` (Bookshop live) are both thin gates over
`_component-library/bookshop/rosey-markup.js`. Add any new `rosey*` filter to
both; `npm run test:roseyParity` fails otherwise.

**Never put `roseyNs` / `roseyRoot` on the same element as `roseyTag` /
`roseyMarkdown`.** Rosey (the build) applies an element's own namespace before
building its key; the RCC editor client starts from the parent and ignores it, so
the two save and read different keys. Put the namespace on an untagged ancestor
(the component root is usually free), fold it into the key when the tagged element
*is* the root (`{% capture k %}{{ _uuid }}:text{% endcapture %}<div{{ text |
roseyMarkdown: k }}>`), or keep the root on the element and move the tag onto an
inner span with `roseyWrap` (`<p{{ "common" | roseyRoot }}>{{ "Read more" |
roseyWrap: "ui:read-more" }}</p>`). `npm run test:roseyKeys` checks the built site
for this, for nested tags, and for one key carrying two different strings.

**One key, one string.** A component included several times as a sub-field
(`generic/textBlock` for a heading's eyebrow / headline / description) must get a
distinct key per include and must not inherit the parent's `_uuid` a second time:
`{% bookshop "generic/textBlock" text: content.headline _uuid: "" roseyKey:
"headline" %}`. Repeated array items get their own `_uuid` on an untagged per-item
wrapper. The same key must always render the same text — derive shared labels
(tags, countdown units) one way everywhere.

**Snippets and editor-only notices are never tagged.** A snippet renders inside a
rich-text region that is already one translation, so its wrapper pipes the output
through `roseyStrip`; `generic/notification` and `generic/styledText` carry no
tags at all.

**A post's markdown body is one translation.** `layouts/post.html` tags the
`<article data-cms-edit="content">` with `roseyMarkdown: "post-body"` and the
generated table of contents with `post-toc` (both TOC placements share the key).
The per-post root on `<main>` keeps them unique, and snippets inside the body are
already stripped, so nothing nests.

**Keys are static, never derived from content.** A key is the `:`-joined chain of
`data-rosey-root` / `data-rosey-ns` values above an element plus its own
`data-rosey`, so a leaf key only has to be unique inside its own component. This
is what lets the connector mark a translation *stale* when the source text
changes, instead of orphaning it under a new key the way v1's slugified-text keys
did. The piped value is still the text, used only to skip tagging empty elements.

**Every component that renders text needs a per-instance namespace.** Add `_uuid:`
to its blueprint and emit `{{ _uuid | roseyNs }}` on its root element; repeating
items inside a component each need their own `_uuid` too. `_uuid` is declared once
globally in `cloudcannon.config.yml` with `instance_value: UUID`, so CloudCannon
fills it in as blocks are added — do not put a literal UUID in a blueprint.
`_componentId` is NOT a substitute: it identifies a component *type*, so every
instance shares one. Form inputs reuse their existing per-instance `id` instead.
`npm run test:roseyIds` reports content blocks missing a `_uuid`.

**Anything global must be translated once, not once per page.** Site chrome opens
the shared `common` root (`{{ "common" | roseyRoot }}` on the header in
`site-head.html` and the footer in `site-foot.html`), so `common:nav:home` is a
single key across the whole site. Use `common:` for anything that reads the same
everywhere: fixed UI strings (`common:ui:learn-more`, `common:ui:previous`), the
site-wide banner, the tag taxonomy (`common:tag:<slug>`), countdown unit labels.
Nav and footer links are keyed by their label (`common:nav:<label-slug>`,
content-as-key), not their URL: placeholder links and Home all point at `/`, which
sanitises to an empty key.
Collection cards instead root on the item they render
(`{% capture cardRoot %}item:{{ url }}{% endcapture %}`), so a post's title is one
translation wherever its card appears. `<main>` opens a per-page root from the
page URL — not the title, which would re-key the page when someone retitles it.

Do not tag editor placeholder strings ("Add content to this section"); they are
not site copy.

## Technology Preferences

- **Interactivity/Logic:** Use [hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org) where possible. If hyperscript would be cumbersome or require workarounds, use vanilla JavaScript instead.
- **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS as the default. For complex styling that Tailwind handles poorly, use SCSS instead.
- **Rounding:** Never hardcode border-radius values or Tailwind rounding classes directly. Always reference the theme rounding variables from `src/_data/theme.yml` via Liquid: `{{ theme.button_rounding }}` for buttons, `{{ theme.image_rounding }}` for images, and `{{ theme.container_rounding }}` for containers (cards, form inputs, dropdowns, etc.). These variables resolve to Tailwind rounding classes (e.g. `rounded`, `rounded-md`) and are applied directly in component class attributes.
- **Background Images:** Never use CSS `background-image` for background images. Instead, use an actual image element (via the bookshop image component) positioned absolutely behind the content. This allows images to go through Eleventy's image optimization pipeline (responsive variants, LQIP, etc.). The pattern is a wrapper div with `absolute inset-0` containing the image component with `object-cover`, and content layered on top with `z-10`. See `sections/bannerHero` and `sections/fullImageHero` for reference.
